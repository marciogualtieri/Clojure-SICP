My first stab at functional programming. I'm following 
["Programming Clojure"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5853610-programming-clojure) for Clojure syntax.

["Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) or SICP is my guide to thinking functionally though.

I thought that would be a great opportunity to tackle this classic and dense computer science book.
 
 So far I have implemented the following methods:

* Square root computation.
* Fibonacci Sequence generator.
* Towers of Hanoi solver.

## Installation

Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) and then on a terminal:

    $ lein test

## Usage

    $ lein run

## Examples

    $ lein run

    SQUARE ROOT OF 2.000: 1.414
    FIBONACCI NUMBER WITH INDEX 10: 55
    HANOI TOWERS SOLUTION FOR 3 DISKS: (\A \B),(\A \C),(\B \C),(\A \B),(\C \A),(\C \B),(\A \B)
