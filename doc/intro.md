# Introduction to sicp

My first stab at functional programming with Clojure. I'm following "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
 (SICP) as my guide to thinking functionally. So far implemented the following methods:

* Square root computation.
* Fibonacci Sequence generator.
* Towers of Hanoi solver.
